# PROCEDURE:
## STEP 1-Identify the Problem:
Start by determining the specific issue or error you're encountering. Is it a system crash, slow performance, software not working, or something else?

## STEP 3-Check for Updates:
Ensure your operating system, drivers, and software are up to date. Sometimes,updating can resolve compatibility or security issues updating can resolves.

## STEP 4-Restart the System:
A simple restart can often fix minor glitches and improve system performance.

## STEP 5-Check Hardware:
If it's a hardware-related issue, ensure that all hardware components are properly connected and functioning. Look for loose cables, overheating, or hardware failures.

## STEP 6-Run Diagnostic Tools:
Use built-in diagnostic tools provided by the operating system to identify hardware or software problems.

## STEP 7-Review Event Logs:
Check the system logs for error messages or warnings that might provide clues about the issue. In Windows, you can use the Event Viewer; in Linux, check syslog or journalctl.

## STEP 8-Remove Recently Installed Software:
If the problem started after installing new software, consider uninstalling it to see if that resolves the issue.

## STEP 9-Safe Mode:
Boot the system into safe mode to check if the problem persists. Safe mode loads the OS with minimal drivers and can help identify if third-party software is causing the issue.

## STEP 11-Check Disk and File System:
Use built-in utilities like chkdsk (Windows) or fsck (Linux) to scan and repair disk errors and file system issues.

## STEP 13-System Restore:
If applicable, consider using system restore points to revert your system to a previous state when it was working correctly.
